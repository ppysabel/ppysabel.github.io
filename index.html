               <p class="item aboutme">My name is Ysabel Kuang. I am currently pursuing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
                    Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN</span> from MIT|xPRO. I am looking for a 
                    position as a full stack developer. During college, I worked part time in retail 
                    and restaurants. After graduating with a B.S in Nursing from SJSC, I worked as an 
                    insurance agent and administrator in Allstate Insurance for 5 years. During these 
                    years, I took care of clients matters including quote, education, filing claims, 
                    etc. I also maintained office daily uses. Outside of work, I like to explore places 
                    I have never been and collecting National Parkâ€™s stamps. My favorite sports are 
                    badminton and basketball. (Go Warriors!)
